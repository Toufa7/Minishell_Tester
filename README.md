# Minishell_Tester

## NB: Works on macOS only, not Ubuntu. I'll work on it later, or you are welcome to contribute as well :)

A simple Minishell tester, it checks your output and your exit status are similar to the bash or not also it checks it compare your return errors else it returns where's your wrong see :

    ./tester.sh --help


$$\textcolor{Green}{\text{[OK]  }}{\text{Means that your output and the exit status are similar to the bash}}\textcolor{yellow}{\text{}}$$

$$\textcolor{Red}{\text{[KO]  }}{\text{Means one of your output or the exit status or both are wrong to the bash}}\textcolor{yellow}{\text{}}$$
